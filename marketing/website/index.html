      <h2>Naked Roadmap is Coming Soon!</h2>
      <p>Naked Roadmap is an open source planning app. It’s <strong>free</strong> and <strong>self hosted</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>
        Naked Roadmap is designed for small to mid size teams who need a lightweight process support.
        It helps teams manage goals and projects, run planning meetings, and capture retrospectives for process improvements.
      </p>

      <h3>Aren’t there other roadmap and project management tools out there? Why this?</h3>
      <p>
        Of course there are other tools out there. But Naked Roadmap is designed to be uncomplicated and light weight. It strips away unnecessary features and processes in favor of what's been proven to work: simple requirements and project details, basic sprint cycles, and a way to see what’s being worked on at any time.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        In our experience, that’s all you need to run an effective roadmap and planning process. Everything else is noise.

      <h1>Concepts</h1>
      <h2>Objectives, Projects, Cycles</h2>
      <p>Naked Roadmap is built around three core concepts: an <strong>Objective</strong>, a <strong>Project</strong>, and a <strong>Cycle</strong>.</p>

      <div style="display:flex; flex-flow:row; align-items: space-between; width:150%; margin-left: -25%;">
        <div style="border:1px solid black; background-color:white; border-radius:10px;margin:10px; padding:20px;">
          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <p>Objectives are exactly what they sound like: the thing you're trying to achieve. Some people call these goals or OKRs.</p>
          <p>An Objective provides clarity about where the company (or team) is going and what you're working towards. Objectives show up on a lot of different pages so that you never forget why you're doing what you're doing.</p>
          <p><em>Are you more familiar with goals or OKRs? They're all different ways of saying similar things and you can use them semi-interchangeably.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div style="border:1px solid black; background-color:white; border-radius:10px;margin:10px; padding:20px;">
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <h4>Project as Unit of Work</h4>
          <p>Projects are the things you work on. A project can start out as an idea, be as small as a single task, or end up being a multi-cycle, multi-phase deliverable. It's up to you.</p>
          <h4>Project as Documentation</h4>
          <p>Projects are documented like a light-weight PRD: you provide some context around the problem or opportunity, the reason for why you're choosing to work on it, business (or technical) requirements, and then a plan for making sure it solves the problem post-launch or monitoring data.</p>
          <p>Anything more than than can generally falls into one of those four categories via the text editor. Say you have a robust interviewing and research process... that's context. Or you do a lot of stack ranking with stakeholders and that's why this has been prioritized... that's prioritization reason.</p>
          <p>The aim of this approach is to reduce cognitive overhead required to get someone up to speed on what the work is. It's the 'naked' piece: tell it straight, tell it simply.</p>
          <h4>Project Ownership</h4>
          <p>Oh, and a project is assigned to a single "Directly Responsible Individual" (DRI) and a team that's working on it. The DRI goes by many names, but it's the person with whom the buck stops. The person who you turn to for information, the person who rallies the troops, the person who is responsible for making sure this is a success. I hope that's you!</p>
          <p><em>Are you more familiar with PRDs? They're all different ways of saying similar things and you can use them semi-interchangeably.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div style="border:1px solid black; background-color:white; border-radius:10px;margin:10px; padding:20px;">
          <h3>Cycles</h3>
          <p>Cycles are 'cycles of work' and are what many companies might call a "Sprint". We don't call them "Sprints" because that has a lot of baggage involved. They can vary in length and ritual. Planning can happen asynchronously before being committed. So instead of calling it sprints, we call it cycles of work.</p>
          <p>You can have multiple cycles running, but we encourage keeping only one cycle active at a time.</p>
          <p><em>Are you more familiar with Sprints? A cycle and a sprint have a lot of overlaps and you can use them semi-interchangeably.</em></p>

      <h2>Relationships Between Things</h2>

      <h3>Objectives and Projects</h3>
      <p>A project can (and should) be assigned to an objective. That rolls back up to show you whether you're doing work, or you're moving company initiatives forward. A project can currently be assigned to only one Objective, but an Objective can have many supporting projects.</p>

      <h3>Commitments (Projects and Cycles)</h3>
      <p>A Project is assigned to be worked on during a sprint by documenting a "commitment". Why a commitment? Our experience is that it's too easy to get lost in the details of task breakdowns. That's useful, but not here. Your audience wants to know what they'll get when your cycle of work is completed. That's your plain-language commitment. "If we take this on for two weeks, we expect to give you X at the end of that time." Don't bury the lede.</p>
      <p>Commitments are not tasks. They're units of delivery.</p>
      <p>Sometimes a commitment is a task, sometimes it's a bundle of tasks. Sometimes it's a feature or a test or an interview or a document. Commitments make it easy to see the progress being made on a project and how actively it's being worked on. You have to recommit a project each cycle, so the work is very intentional. Commitments drive key metrics: a team's ability to deliver work is measured in part by their track record of completing each cycle's commitments.</p>
