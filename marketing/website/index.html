      <h2>Naked Roadmap is Coming Soon!</h2>
      <p>Naked Roadmap is an open source planning app. It’s <strong>free</strong> and <strong>self hosted</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>
        Naked Roadmap is designed for small to mid size teams who need a lightweight process support.
        It helps teams manage goals and projects, run planning meetings, and capture retrospectives for process improvements.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Aren’t there other roadmap and project management tools out there? Why this?</h3>
      <p>
        Of course there are other tools out there. But Naked Roadmap is designed to be uncomplicated and light weight. It strips away unnecessary features and processes in favor of what's been proven to work: simple requirements and project details, basic sprint cycles, and a way to see what’s being worked on at any time.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        In our experience, that’s all you need to run an effective roadmap and planning process. Everything else is noise.
